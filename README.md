The Aircraft mod for Factorio, now updated for Space Age.

This is a fork of Thomasnotused's Aircraft mod, updated for 2.0 with specific changes for Space Age.

Changes:
- All aircraft now support logistic requests and can be remotely flown.
- Changed "Advanced Aerodynamics" technology to unlock after crafting 100 robot frames.
- Changed "Aircraft Energy Shield" technology to require researching gunships.

Changes when Space Age is enabled:
- Aircraft can only be placed on Nauvis and Fulgora. Aircraft require at least 700 hPa pressure and at most 15 m/s^2 gravity.
- "Jets" technology requires Space and Agricultural science packs. Recipe changed to require Carbon Fiber.
- "Flying Fortress" technology requires Metallurgic and Agricultural science packs. Recipe changed to require Carbon Fiber.
- "Aircraft Energy Shield" technology requires Space and Electromagnetic science packs.
- "Afterburner" technology requires Space science packs.
- "Rocket Silo" technology requires "Cargo Planes" as a prerequisite.
- "Space platform thruster" technology requires "Afterburner" as a prerequisite.

Based on MaciejGorczyca's development fork of "Aircraft," which used AI to update most code to 2.0's conventions, and removed the majority of bugs. I fixed the remaining bugs noted by MaciejGorczyca, and made Space Age-specific changes to technologies and recipes. https://github.com/Stifling-Bossness/Aircraft/pull/65

Original Description:

The Aircraft mod adds various aircraft to Factorio. Factorio is a game about building and managing factories while also defending yourself from the native population who do not like the factory pollution destroying the planet. The later stages of the game can be boring due to the constant traveling back and forth between factories. The added aircraft all have different uses:

    The jet is very quick and can be used to commute back and forth between distant outposts
    The cargo plane is very spacious and can be used to cargo numerous items far distances
    The flying fortress is an attack aircraft that can easily destroy natives daring to protest the pollution
    The gunship is a balance of the other three aircraft

I also tried to make sure that Aircraft mod is compatible with other mods. The mod supports some of the larger mods, such as Bob's mods. I also attempted to make patches for some smaller mods like Raven and Helicopters. If there are any mods that are incompatible, let me know so I can try to fix it.
