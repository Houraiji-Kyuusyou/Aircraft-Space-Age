[technology-description]
advanced-aerodynamics=Further research into high-speed aerodynamics.
gunships=Combat and cargo aircraft, the standard aircraft which all others are branched off of.
jets=For when you need to get somewhere FAST, comes with a rapid-fire machine gun, homing missile launcher, and a napalm launcher. Yeah, you betcha that napalm hurts.
cargo-planes=A long-range flying chest, comes equipped with a weak machine gun, and no equipment grid, but has an enormous cargo capacity.
flying-fortress=The ultimate in aerial superiority, comes with a tank cannon (Yes, you read that right), a high round-per-minute machine gun, a homing missile launcher, and a huge equipment grid!
high-explosive-cannon-shells=10x (theoretically) stronger explosive shells, for when dead isn't good enough.
afterburner=Push your aircraft to the speed limit with an afterburner!
aircraft-energy-shield=Lightweight, high-capacity shield modules designed for heavy fire.
napalm=A longer-burning alternative to flamethrower fuel, works especially well when fired from vehicle-mounted launchers!
gunships-carbon-fiber=Lightweight alternative to conventional gunships.

[mod-setting-description]
aircraft-sound-setting=Uncheck if you want to use the car sounds instead of the jet sounds in all aircraft.
aircraft-hardmode=Generally makes aircraft easier for the biters to destroy, use at your own peril!
aircraft-belt-immunity=Aircraft are not moved by belts.
helicopter-tech=Gates the Helicopter technology behind the Advanced Aerodynamics technology. Use only if you have HelicoptersRevival installed.

lex-tech=Gates Lex's Aircraft behind the Advanced Aerodynamics technology. Use only if you have Lex's Aircraft installed.
heli-equipment-grid=Gives Helicopters the right to use aircraft-specific equipment. Use only if you have HelicoptersRevival installed.
non-combat-mode=Disables the Jet, Gunship, and Flying Fortress from the tech tree. (Currently irreversible per-save!)
inserter-immunity=Makes all aircraft immune to inserters, except for fuel insertion.
lock-surfaces-space-age=Restricts aircraft based on surface conditions. Only relevant to Space Age.
